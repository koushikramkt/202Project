My XP value is Eliminate Waste. Everyone in the team had a task of learning one design pattern and teaching the other people. I decided to read two design patterns. 1. Observer. 2. Strategy. I studied observer pattern when I was doing my previous assignment and it was very useful. We decided to use Observer pattern for displaying the scores to the users. In our case the Quiz World will be the Subject and the players would be the Observers. The players would subscribe for the scores and the Subject will notify them whenever there is a change. However, in claass, Prof. Paul said that Observer pattern with REST can't be used as discussed in the class and we have to come up with our variation of Observer pattern to achieve this. 

My job was to create three levels for strategy pattern. Easy, medium and Hard. Although I implemented the patern correctly, I found some bugs while answering the questions. Eventhough, the player was selecting the righ t answer the Quiz world was showing it as wrong due to a bug in my code. I'm currently trying to fix it. I also urged other people to start coding with one design pattern each and everyone agreed to the same. We also spoke with 2 of our friends from other departments to help us with the Extra credit. We requested them to sit and review the game for us after we develop the final version of the game.
