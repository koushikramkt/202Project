Rohan KankapurkarWeek #3XP Values: SimplicityIn this week we decided we will build the initial model of our game. We all agreed and decided that Kaushik will be building the initial model of the game. We decided that every week integration will be made on this basic version of the game. This model now only supports one level and limited question set. In order to integrate I opted for building database schema and designing the counter for the game in two player model. In order to develop this model further it is very important that everyone in the team understands the model and sort out the integration modules that are critical to implement. In order to maintain the simplicity, we will implement important modules before implementing the additional functionality to the game. Also we will be drawing diagrams before coding. This will ensure that each and every line of code will support the current model. This will eliminate the work of removing unused functions in future. In the first two weeks the game requirements were not fixed. Now that our requirements are clear and every team member has clear idea about the game, we will be distributing the work among team members. Each team member took responsibility and assigned several backlogs to themselves. We all will be working toward the next incremental model of our game this week by adding more functionality and making it more interactive. Since we all had to go the SVCC camp, we could not meet this weekend. We will be covering this work in next week.
