My role in the team is to Eliminate waste and make sure that everyone in the team follows the same. As planned, we all met on Saturday after class
to discuss the status of the project. We discussed the various tasks that we created and assigned it among ourselves. Everyone felt that we needed an initial
code/baseline code on which we can work. I took the responsibility to develop the baseline code. Everyone agreed to the same. It was decided that I will develop
the baseline code and push it to GIT and everyone will start working on their individual modules after that. As promised, I developed the baseline code and gave it to the team by Thursday. I referred to various examples in greenfoot and came up with the simplest form of the game. The initial version that I gave had questions hard coded into a list. We have planned to modularize this by having a persistent database in the cloud and generating questions at random. We also planned to develop a 
multi player version of the same, since the initial version was just a single player version. Everyone in the team appreciated my work and it was decided that going forward no one will directly commit to the master. We all agreed upon it and decided to create new branches, whenever we have something to commit. We couldn't meet 
this saturday as everyone was busy with SVCC. We are planning to meet on any of the weekdays and decide what to do next.
