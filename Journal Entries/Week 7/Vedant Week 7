XP Core value â€“ Communication

Now that we have reached week 7 and have a lot of things to do in order to finish the game. Since my core value is communication I asked everyone whether they think from now meeting twice or thrice a week will be a good idea. Everyone agreed and so we started to meet twice or thrice a week. Everyone have now studied various patterns and we have shortlisted which patterns we could implement in our code. 

We decided that we will use Observer pattern for maintaining score to both the users using observer pattern. We are also going to integrate Strategy patter in our game. Now we are also having sessions where we sit together and work on the game and integrate. We are doing this after every meeting. 

We are also going to work for extra credit as well for the CS unplugged. This we are going to do in the first week o December.
