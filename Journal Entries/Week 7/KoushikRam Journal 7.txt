The Xp core value that I have chosen is Eliminate Waste. As we all have reached Week 7 and we have more things to complete, we al l decided to meet twice or thrice a week and work. Last week I gave the base code for Observer pattern and Gaurang said that he will start working on the multiplayer version of the game. I advised him to start with saving the sessions on the Cloud. I also advised him to use the Observer pattern to display the score to both the users. Everyone thought it was a good idea and Gauarang said that he will use the started code that I commmitted last week for the same. As we are towards the end of the Game development, we started working on the extra credit part as well. We gathered a list of ten members for the small event that we will be conducting during the first week of December. 

I slowly learnt how to integrate multiple patterns in the code. Earlier, I was able to use only one pattern for a particular functionality and now I planned to utilize two or three design patterns for the same functionality to give better flexibility to the code. My task for the week was to finish the Strategy pattern and merge it with the existing code. I also thought of adding another screen after the 'Start Game' screen whi has various options for Single player and Multi player levels. I told Gaurang to initialize his function or piece of code, when the user presses the Multi player option in the screen that I will be creating. 

After this week, we planned to sit continously for 2 or 3 days and integrate every piece of code. Now we planned to concentrate more on functionality of the game. Each person was asssigned a functionality, which should be finished by the end of next week. The final week will be utilized for integration.
