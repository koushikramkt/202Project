We have made the initial version of the game. This is a single player version of the game. We learnt about some of the basics of
cloud concepts during the previous session and now we got an idea on how to do the multi player version of the game. Vedant, Rohan and Gauarang made some changes to the UI. We then decided to start with the design patterns. We planned to implement State, Observer, Strategy and Proxy design patterns. We also discussed the cases/scenarios where we can include these design patterns. The discussion was very fruitful and we got some idea about design patterns. We also wanted to make sure that we use the appropriate design pattern and not use them just for the sake of including them.

I took the initiative and decided to start coding using the design patterns. I saw some tutorials for Strategy design pattern and understood the basics of it. I though it would be nice if we implement Strategy design pattern for the game levels Easy, Medium, hard. I first gave a skeleton for the Strategy design pattern and then included it in my code. We were all very happy with the start we had and decided to explore more on design patterns before implementing them. 

Now, the task for everyone is to read about a design pattern and teach it to the other team members so that everyone will understand the fundamentals of the design pattern. This way, we can implement them more effectively.
