My XP core value is Eliminate Waste. This being the final week, everyone is invloved in optimizing the code. My XP value being Eliminate Waste, I have removed a lot of redunant code and also fixed some of the bugs that we found. Now we have the Server logic up and running for the Multiplayer game. The only thing that we need to write is the Client logic for the game. Once this is done, we have planned to test the entire code from end to end. Since we have adopted design patterns early in our code, our code is very modular and easy to change. I also emphasized the team to work on the Extra Credit Project. We have invited 10 of our friends from other departments, so that we get atleast 5-6 people for the final video session. 

I'm currently working on the design patterns Proxy and Adapter. I'm also working on score keeping. We have to maintain the timer and scores for both the players and synchronization is very important. We are having some issues with synchronization and currently we are learning how to use Messaging Queues to achieve the same. We nay use any of the messaging queues like Rabbit MQ or MQTT to achieve concurrency. We are planning to deploy all our server side logic to AWS. CUrrently, everything is in localhost. We all have set up the environment for that in local. Once we set up everything in cloud, we won't be in need of any local server. Once this is done, we will start our extra credit session. We are planning to implement this by the end of next week. We hope everything turns out well and we are able to finish things on time.
