Week 4Rohan KankapurkarXP value Simplicity:This week we distributed the work among all the team members. Each team member was assigned with some responsibility. Since we decided that the game is going to be multiplayer, in order to store the questions, answers and hints we will be using cloud. The jobs were distributed among the team members such that they are not overlapping each other. All the modules are exclusive and we will be bringing together all the modules in the end. Kaushik will be working on the database part where he will be inserting all the questions and answers in the table. Gaurang will be working on the question-answer counter where the module will show how many questions user has answered correctly and how many he/she has failed. Vedant and I will be working on GUI part where we will take care of designing the game and adding animations so that the game becomes more user friendly and attractive than the basic model.In order to enforce simplicity, we divided the work such a way that the distributing is exclusive. Each team member can work independently to achieve his target. These were the small simple steps that added in order to reach the goal. So we decided the features we want in the game, distributed them and will be coding for the same. Here we will also make sure that our code is Testable, Understandable, Browsable and Explainable.
